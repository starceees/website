# Raghuram Cauligi Srinivas

This repository contains the source for my personal website. It is a simple static site built with HTML and CSS and is deployed through GitHub Pages.

The main page (`index.html`) lists my research publications, selected projects and contact information. Images and PDFs are stored in the `data/` directory and additional project demos live in the `mipnerf`, `mipnerf360` and `zipnerf` folders.

## Local preview

Open `index.html` in any web browser to preview the site. Changes pushed to the `master` branch are automatically deployed by the accompanying GitHub Actions workflow.
